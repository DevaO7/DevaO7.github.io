                <h3>Workshop: Reinforcement Learning: Recent Trends and Future Challenges @ IISc Banglore(26th-28th February 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    My first ever academic event! I had a very basic idea of RL and mostly went in for the exposure. As you might have guessed, I did not understand a good number of lectures, but to an extent got a top-level overview. But this helped me understand the skills that I need to build, the mathematical concepts that I have to strengthen, and the courses I have to do and yes, this process kicked in once I started zoning out of a lecture XD. The top-level overview helped me better understand and differentiate between theoretical and application-inclined research. And wow, the lecturers were extremely smart and their presentations were so engaging and sometimes had jokes! – so cool :)

                    The best part of the workshop was the opportunity to interact with these amazing people. I had trouble approaching professors before this event as “I did not want to come off as dumb”, but listening to other students’ interactions during this event helped me understand that, the questions I had were legit, and even if the questions were dumb, it is ok and professors are not some sea monsters to gobble you up, but are very approachable.

                    Another highlight of this event, I was introduced to Category Theory and its applications to Machine Learning by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html">Dr. Sridhar Mahadevan</a> during his lectures (lecture slides available on his webpage). Seems like an interesting research direction, “Building Machine Learning from a Categorical theory point-of-view!”
