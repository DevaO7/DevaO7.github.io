      I started running in November of 2023. I aim to cover a distance of 40k km by my 40th birthday :)
      – that’s roughly the Earth’s circumference! And maybe complete half and full Iron Man someday, XD

          <h3>Best way to Celebrate Graduation? Second HM!  (July 21, 2024)</h3>
  
          <p>
            This run was meant to test a training regimen I had been following for a few months in the lead-up to race day. The natural goal after your first HM is to aim for Sub-2-hour HM. Lesson from the previous HM: The last 3kms were brutal, so the goal was to endure it! A not-so-well-thought plan – increase the long run distance every Saturday, and on alternate weekdays, go all out in a 5K.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            It did not quite work well. Felt burnt out with the ever-increasing mileage week after week. Eventually had to give up the training plan. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            On race day, I just knew I was not gonna hit a PB. So ran for purely the fun of it, observing the people, the scenes, the smell of the beach, taking pictures, updating my friends the milestones I have hit. As expected, the last 3km were so brutal, more brutal than the first HM. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            But I guess, I was already high on accomplishment. I graduated just two days before the run, and finishing this run was a cherry on the top!
          </p>

          <p>
            And on a side note, this run was also special because, my thambi Mohnish was running the 10km race :)

        <h3>Inter-Hostel Road Race! (5th February, 2024)</h3>

        <p>
          It was a RACE! In all the long-distance running events I have participated in up till this point,
          my goal was just to beat my own PB. And there was a bit of pressure to put in my efforts to fetch
          points for my hostel. I reached the starting point around 7 am, only to see some awesome athletes
          from various high-stamina-requiring sports warming up! And I saw this foreign exchange student
          making warm-up runs. I have seen him run on the athletic ground (Watsa) and damn, he is good.
          PRESSURE!!
        </p>

        <p>
          But finally, before the race, I just stuck with a Kobe Bryant quote, which roughly goes like this,
          “Don’t play to win or Don’t play to not lose, play to figure things out!” I just have to give my
          best, doesn’t matter if I come first or last and I can learn from whatever the result is
        </p>

        <p>
          And I think I did it! Gave my best. Set my PB in the 5k (in 23:44 mins) and completed the whole
          course (8 km) with an average pace of 4:46/km, which was honestly surprising to me, because never
          completed a distance &gt;5 km under 5:00/km pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          I finished 17th of the 70+ participants with a timing of 36:14 mins. Like I guessed, the foreign
          exchange won the race and I guess he completed it in 29: XX mins (hmmm, damn). Our hostel-Narmada,
          finished 4th and we got 2 points! It was fun! :)

        <h3>My First Half Marathon (6th January 2024)</h3>

        <p>
          Honestly, I was pretty nervous the day before. In fact, I just wanted to call it quits and was
          finding reasons to drop at the last minute. Thankfully, I did not, as it turned out to be one of
          the best experiences. My aim for the marathon was to complete it, that’s all!
        </p>

        <p>
          The first 15 km was easy peasy. I ran a 15k precisely a week before the HM. But after the 15 km
          mark, every km was a beautiful struggle. I was determined not to walk at any cost except for maybe
          a few meters before and after every aid station. Oh boy, I just sprinted the last km and did not
          know I had the energy to do so. But yeah, crossing the finish line, gulping a whole bottle of
          water, letting your heartbeat settle, and finally, the fact that you completed HM sinks in –
          It's one of the most excellent feelings!
        </p>

        <p>
          I had the amazing opportunity to meet some of the most down-to-earth elite runners. It was an
          amazing chance to learn from them.
