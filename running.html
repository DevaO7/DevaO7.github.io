                  Running
                </p>
                <p>I started running in November of 2023, and I have so far covered a distance of 169.1 km. I aim to cover a distance of 40k km by my 40th birthday :) - that’s roughly the Earth’s circumference! And maybe also to complete half and full Iron Man someday, XD</p>
                <h3>My First Half Marathon</h3>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I was pretty nervous the day before. In fact, I just wanted to call it quits and was finding reasons to drop at the last minute. Thankfully, I did not, as it turned out to be one of the best experiences. My aim for the marathon was to complete it, that’s all! 
                  </p>

                    The first 15 km was easy peasy. I ran a 15k precisely a week before the HM. But after the 15km mark, every km was a beautiful struggle. I was determined not to walk at any cost except for maybe a few meters before and after every aid station. Oh boy, I just sprinted the last km and did not know I had the energy to do so. But yeah, crossing the finish line, gulping a whole bottle of water, letting your heartbeat settle, and finally, the fact that you completed HM sinks in. It's one of the most excellent feelings!
