                  Running
                </p>
                <p>I started running in November of 2023. I aim to cover a distance of 40k km by my 40th birthday :) - that’s roughly the Earth’s circumference! And maybe complete half and full Iron Man someday, XD</p>
                <h3>Inter-Hostel Road Race! (5th February, 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                  It was a RACE! In all the long-distance running events I have participated in up till this point, my goal was just to beat my own PB.  And there was a bit of pressure to put in my efforts to fetch points for my hostel. I reached the starting point around 7 am, only to see some awesome athletes from various high-stamina-requiring sports warming up! And I saw this foreign exchange student making warm-up runs. I have seen him run on the athletic ground (Watsa) and damn, he is good. PRESSURE!!
                  </p>
                <p>
                  But finally, before the race, I just stuck with a Kobe Bryant quote, which roughly goes like this, “Don’t play to win or Don’t play to not lose, play to figure things out!” I just have to give my best, doesn’t matter if I come first or last and I can learn from whatever the result is
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I think I did it! Gave my best. Set my PB in the 5k (in 23:44 mins) and completed the whole course (8 km) with an average pace of 4:46/km, which was honestly surprising to me, because never completed a distance >5km under 5:00/km pace.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  I finished 17th of the 70+ participants with a timing of 36:14 mins. Like I guessed, the foreign exchange won the race and I guess he completed it in 29: XX mins (hmmm, damn). Our hostel-Narmada, finished 4th and we got 2 points! It was fun! :)

                  <h3>My First Half Marathon (6th January 2024)</h3>
                  <p>
                      Honestly, I was pretty nervous the day before. In fact, I just wanted to call it quits and was finding reasons to drop at the last minute. Thankfully, I did not, as it turned out to be one of the best experiences. My aim for the marathon was to complete it, that’s all! 
                    </p>
                  <p>
                    The first 15 km was easy peasy. I ran a 15k precisely a week before the HM. But after the 15km mark, every km was a beautiful struggle. I was determined not to walk at any cost except for maybe a few meters before and after every aid station. Oh boy, I just sprinted the last km and did not know I had the energy to do so. But yeah, crossing the finish line, gulping a whole bottle of water, letting your heartbeat settle, and finally, the fact that you completed HM sinks in - It's one of the most excellent feelings!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had the amazing opportunity to meet some of the most down-to-earth elite runners. It was an amazing chance to learn from them.
